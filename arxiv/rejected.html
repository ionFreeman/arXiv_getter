<h1>Access Denied</h1>
<p>Sadly, you do not currently appear to have permission to access
<b>https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/0911.2829v1</b></p>
<p>If you are using the PDF Plug-in, it has many bugs and is forbidden here
due to problems it causes at the server end.
You must confirm that you have disabled it before access can be restored.</p>
<p>In Netscape try 
    <code>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Navigator -&gt; Applications</code>,
    look for <code>Portable Document Format</code> and uncheck the plug-in box.
    Or delete the pdf plugin dll file from the
    <code>Program Files/Netscape/Navigator/Program/plugins</code>
    directory and restart browser. Or for Acroread4/Explorer5 users, 
    go into Acroread's 
    <code>File : Preferences : General : Web_Browser_Integration</code>
    and make sure the little box is unchecked.</p>
<p><b>Note to MacOSX users</b>: There is a bug in the Acrobat reader which
    causes it to make endless streams of requests <i>after</i> having
    successfully downloaded the full pdf. Note that it is not necessary to
    use Acrobat at all, since pdf's from here render as well or better
    in the default Preview.app on MacOSX. If for some reason you think you
    need to use Acrobat, go to Acrobat <code>Preferences -&gt; Internet</code>
    and turn off the 
    "Allow speculative downloading in the background" option, which comes
    (incorrectly) turned on by default, and whose behavior is quite broken.
    </p>
